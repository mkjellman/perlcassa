This is Perl module perlcassa.

VERSION
	v0.03

INSTALLATION
	perlcassa can be installed by doing the usual:
		$ perl Makefile.PL
		$ make
		$ make install

DESCRIPTION
	perlcassa is a native Perl client for interfacing with Apache Cassandra. It is essentially an API for Apache Thrift. It intelligently deals with CompositeType columns and ValidationClasses and encodes and packs them appropriately for the columnfamily specified.

Note: This package does not support SuperColumns. Please look into CompositeType Comparators instead.

DOCUMENTATION
	Documentation is light at this time and will be improved in the next version. For now please refer to the documentation available in POD format or look through the examples in the examples folder.

SYNOPOSIS
	my $obj = new perlcassa(
                'columnfamily'  => 'myCF',
                'keyspace'      => 'myKeyspace',
                'hosts'         => ['host1.cassandra.local', 'host2.cassandra.local', 'host3.cassandra.local'],
                
                #optional

                'port'                    => '9160'
        );

        my %composite = ('values' => ['name_pt1', 'name_pt2']);

        $obj->insert(
                'key'           => 'myKey',
                'columnname'    => \%composite,
                'value'         => 'myVal'
        );

        $obj->get(
                'key'           => 'myKey',
                'columnname'    => 'myColumn'
        );

	$obj->get_slice(
		'key'           => 'myKey',
		'start'         => ['name_pt1'],
		'finish'        => ['name_pt2','name_pt2_c'],
		'start_equality' => 'equal', #optional (defaults to equal, options: equal, less_than_equal, or greater_than_equal)
		'finish_equality'=> 'greater_than_equal' #optional (defaults to greater_than_equal, options: equal, less_than_equal, or greater_than_equal)
	);

	$obj->get_range_slices(
		key_start => '',
		key_finish => '',
		column_start => ['colpt1','a'],
		column_finish => ['thiscol'],
		key_max_count => 10000,
		buffer_size => 100
	);
        
        my %bulk = (
                #value => [columnname]
                'test'  => ['name_pt1', 'name_pt2'],
                'test2' => ['name_pt3', 'name_pr4']
        );

        $obj->bulk_insert(
                'key'     => 'testkey'
                'columns' => \%bulk
        ); 

TODO
	* better documentation
	* better handling thrift exceptions to try from another provided Cassandra instance/host automagically
	* general performance optimizations
	* auto retry failures where the node is up when the client is created but there is an exception such as a timeout on insert
